# eshop

> A small part of the online store on Vue.js with a list of goods and a shopping cart

## Project demo

> https://vue-eshop.000webhostapp.com 

## Task description

```
The main page displays a list of products with a name, image and price. Each product can be immediately added 
to the shopping cart, with more than one time.
At the top, a link to the "shopping cart" page is displayed with the quantity counter of the ordered goods.

The "shopping cart" page displays the list of ordered goods sorted by the time of the addition (the last one added 
at the top).
Goods from the shopping cart can be deleted (one at a time or all at once), as well as change the number of ordered 
items. 
At the bottom of the page, the total price of the order is displayed.

Functional requirements:
- All actions on the site should take place without reloading the page.
- The interface must meet the usability requirements.
- After the page is reloaded, the state of the contents of the shopping cart must be saved.

Technical requirements:
- You can use JavaScript or TypeScript as the development language.
- As a bundler, if necessary, use Webpack.
- The logic of the application should be broken down into a reasonable number of self-sufficient 
  Vue components.
```
